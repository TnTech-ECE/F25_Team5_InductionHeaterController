## Agenda (brief)
- Meeting with Daniel Rushing

## Electrical Safety, Thermal Management, and Schematic Review

### Safety and Power Protection
- Discussed whether to use **fuses or a circuit breaker** for system protection.  
- Decision pending further evaluation of current draw and reset convenience.  

### LTSpice and EMI Design
- **Austin** meeting with **Dr. Johnson** to discuss LTSpice simulation questions.  
- Main objective: review schematic for **EMI filtering** around the induction coil.  
- **Austin's schematic overview:**
  1. 240 V input -> fuses or breaker  
  2. EMI filtering stage 
  3. Full-bridge rectifier  
  4. DC bus  
  5. Full-bridge inverter  
  6. PWM microcontroller driving integrated circuits (ICs)  

- **Ben Putnam** is responsible for ordering a **new pipe and new coil**.  
- Once pipe and coil arrive, team will conduct **inductance measurements and testing**.  

### Thermal Management
- **IGBTs** are expected to generate significant heat during operation.  
- **Aaron** is designing a **heat sink system** with **fans** for air cooling.  
- Team discussed adding **thermocouples** to monitor IGBT heat sink temperatures.  
- Apply **thermal grease** to the back of transistors for improved heat transfer.  
- Consider adding a **plastic or nonconductive support** around the pipe for electrical insulation and operator safety.  

### Grounding and Circuit Considerations
- Each **gate driver** will have its **own ground**, which will then connect to a **single star ground point**.  
- Verify **U6** component on the schematic is within tolerance for ripple voltage.  
- Consider adding a **smoothing capacitor** across U6 if necessary.  
- Check all **capacitors's ESR ratings** to ensure they meet EMI and filtering requirements.  


## Next Meeting
- **Date:** 2025-12-01  12:00
- **Tentative agenda:** Discussing Detail Design Presentation
