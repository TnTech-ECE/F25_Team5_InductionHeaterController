## Key Discussion Points

### PCB & Power Design
- Discussed power organization:
  - Full-bridge rectifier from 240 V
  - Smoothing and filtering for the DC bus
  - H-bridge transistor configuration
  - Microcontroller high/low signals to the gate driver  
- Integrated gate driver will control transistor switching.  
- Full-bridge chosen for higher power output (and thus greater heating capability).  
- Plan to include:
  - Transformer and switch-mode power supply (SMPS)
  - DC voltage regulators
  - Coupling and decoupling capacitors  
- Focus will be on ensuring proper routing of main driving components.  
- PWM experimentation planned, especially concerning magnetic effects with the SMPS and full-bridge setup.

### Heating & Fluid System
- Discussed heating of a 1-inch pipe and managing water flow.  
- Must determine flow rate and back pressure to avoid flash steam or dangerous overpressure.  
- City water pressure should suffice; no additional pump required.  
- Ball valve recommended for flow control.  

---

### Magnetic & Inductive Design
- Plan to measure inductance (~500 uH) once pipe length is finalized (expected 5-6 ft).  
- Will calculate coil length, inductance, and resonance frequency.  
- Lower frequencies (20-50 kHz) preferred for thicker materials and to avoid audible noise.  
- Induction forge reference will help determine optimal coil and current requirements.  

---

### Testing & Equipment
- Currently missing current probes and differential probes.  
- May request to borrow these from Ojo.  
- Team to specify which probes are needed for testing.  

---

### Sensor & EMI Shielding
- High-frequency, high-power environment requires EMI shielding.  
- Shielding will be applied to:
  - H-bridge circuitry  
  - Enclosure casing  
  - Thermocouple board  
  - Serial communication lines between control boards  

---

### Reference Materials
- Received documentation from last year's Mechanical Engineering (ME) team.  
- Reviewing prior data for insights on power handling and efficiency.  

---

## Action Items
- Finalize conceptual design approval.  
- Begin inductance and resonance frequency calculations.  
- Specify required probes and request equipment loans.  
- Review ME team documents for efficiency benchmarks.
