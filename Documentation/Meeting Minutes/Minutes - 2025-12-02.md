## Connor Murray Discussion Notes

### Variac Procurement and Lab Setup
- Efforts underway to **purchase a Variac** for testing and power control.  
- Desired specs: **230 V, 30 A**.  
- Concern: possible **delay or issue obtaining a Variac** in time.  
- If **faculty approve safety**, Connor and Liz should not have objections.  
- May consider using a **lower-grade** Variac as a temporary alternative.  
- Connor will **check available Variacs**, possibly **1500 W units**.  
- Larger Variacs may be located in **Room 102 (Clement Hall)**.  
- Room 118 is equipped with a **sink** and a **workspace spot** for the team.  

---

### Action Items
- **Order Variac as soon as possible.**  
- Notify Connor Murray once the order is confirmed.  
- **Get an adapter for the sink**   
- Ensure the **company processing the Variac order** includes a **tax exemption agreement** tied to the **project budget**, not the school's general account.  
- Explore the possibility of **modifying the model to operate on 120 V** if Variac availability is limited.
