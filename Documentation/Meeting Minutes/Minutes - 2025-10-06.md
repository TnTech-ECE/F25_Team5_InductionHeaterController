- **4:15** - questions that we will ask Lochinvar
- what are the dimension, if we can see/obtain the material heating (bar stock)
- Would a pancake coil set-up be sufficient or do they have a preferred heating method or recommendations
- if they have specific sizing constraints 

- **4:30** - Met with Dr. storm for weekly catch up on where we are 
- Include pictures, many pictures into the detail design document
- Give reasons why your ideas will work and persuade the reader why 
- Write like the person reading the document doesn't know anything and they can build it
- Details, details, details
- Give reasons why we chose one decision over another
- Model everything efficiently in block diagram 
- Whos in charge of what subsystem, what, and why on that subsystem 
- Justify who and why is working on what
- Individual design is individual grade. 
- Detail design would be done during capstone I is great, thats the goal 
- Buildable schematics is during detail design, give models and simulations
- Bells and whistles for detail design

## Next Meeting
- **Date:** 2025-10-10  11:30
