- **Time:** 1:30-2:45  
- **Location:** Brown Student Lounge   
- **Notetaker:** John Donnell  
- **Week #:** 10

## Attendees
- **Present:** Dow Cox, John Donnell, Austin DuCrest, Aaron Neuharth, Cole Wilson 
- **Absent:** N/A  
- **Quorum met:** Yes

## Agenda (brief)
- discussing the detail design of Power PCB

## Discussion Notes (brief bullets)
- discussed layout of PCB
- all measurments on Power PCb should be correct 
- got some ideas on how to connect Coil to board without cooking board 
- for LCD and other components that would be connented to a bread baord, it will be a simple breakout-style PCB that takes dual-row header pins on one side and routes each pin directly to a corresponding single terminal block connection on the other side.
- going over the Control schematics
- Need to know the pipe specifics (diameter, length, material) so the resistance can be calculated in order to determine the coil's turn ratio

## Next Meeting
- **Date:** 2025-11-21  2:00
- **Tentative agenda:** Meeting with Ben Putnam


## Meeting Info
- **Date:** 2025-11-21  
- **Time:** 2:00-2:30  
- **Location:** Microsoft teams   
- **Notetaker:** John Donnell  
- **Week #:** 10

## Attendees
- **Present:** John Donnell, Austin DuCrest, Aaron Neuharth, Cole Wilson 

## Agenda (brief)
-  Meeting with Ben Putnam with questions on project 

### Piping Information and Material
- No finalized information currently available for pipe specifications.  
- Daniel Rushing may have additional details about piping.  
- Team should conduct independent research - direction is flexible.  
- Possible Pipe materials:
  - **316 Stainless Steel**
  - **409 Stainless Steel**  

### Thermal Modeling Considerations
- Modeling thermal effects on the pipe will be difficult without physical data.  
- Team encouraged to document their own reasoning and assumptions 

### Next Steps / Action Items
- Expect to obtain a physical pipe sample by **first week of December**.  
- Prepare and send a **list of required components** (pipe, fittings, related materials) to **Ben Putnam** soon.  
- If possible, have Ben source a **standard 10 AWG wire** coil for initial tests.  
- Finalize and provide **Bill of Materials (BOM)** to Ben Putnam for procurement.  

## Next Meeting
- **Date:** 2025-11-24  12:00
- **Tentative agenda:** Finalize detail design
